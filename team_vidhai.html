Every Human Life is Precious in this World. Heavy rains in & around me Really exposed my Inability against Nature & My Dependence on God - The Controller of Nature. We came across lot of human Emotions- Love, Fear, Frustration, Loss of Patience, Anxiety, Depression, Anger and this goes on & on... We felt really helpless and clueless as to How we can face this Situation. We couldn't sleep. We felt really guilty that we were not able to share what we have.

This was our Mindset till I came across this powerful living word.
"Do not withhold Good from Those to whom it is due , when it is in your Power to Do it "
This word has Made Us Step out of our Comfort zone to help the Needy.....So

Dear Friends you can Definitely ask us what is  so special about this Initiative
When there is Prime minister&Chief minister Relief Funds contributing for the same cause.
Our answer is simple .We particularly target the unreached area and untargeted people .
We r Not worried about Media coverage r Assembly elections ..Our only Aim is to serve and Win the Hearts of our fellow People.

This project will be House to House ,Door to Door, Man to Man..So much Personalised & Organised. Already our surveying team has started their work.
Anybody willing to join us can contribute in whatever way u want .

The loss is very big after this natural disaster. These 1000 seeds what we sow is just a Drop in the Ocean.
Please do spread this message only to your authentic groups & friends . Jai Hind !
